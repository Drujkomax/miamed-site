# miamed-site

A simple website. This repository now includes automated tests using Jest.

## Running Tests

1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Run the test suite:
   ```sh
   npm test
   ```

The tests verify that `index.html` contains a `<title>` element and that `main.js` can be loaded without syntax errors.
